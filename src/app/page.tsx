      <p>I am the developer of <Link href="https://polishedcrystal.app" target="_blank">PolishedDex</Link>, a fan project for reference data based on the game Polished Crystal.</p>
      <p>I'm not looking for work right now, but I am available for friendly conversation :)</p>
      <p>Eventually I will add more to this site, but right now I am more focused on other projects. One of those things where I would love to do more here, but will I have the time and energy? Who knows.</p>
